compactness of representation of centroid

Therefore, a data stream clustering algorithm must provide a representation of
the clusters found that is not only compact, but it does not grow
appreciably with the number of points processed. (Notice that
even a linear growth is intolerable.)


fast and incremental processing of new data points



clear and fast identification of ''outliers'' : -- 
We have placed the word outliers between quotes, since by that term
we mean to imply points that do not fit well in any of the clusters
that the algorithm has found so far.
